"# cli-passmanager" 

Introduction

Creating a CLI accessible password manager using API's through a mongoDB server and documenting the process. 

This will be done in rust as a learning experience to get used to the many benefits of the language such as:
  - extremely fast performance
  - strong and extremely useful compiler
  - industry leading type system
  - low level
  - memory safety


TODO 

- CLI using Clap 
- move all mongo db credentials to a .env file
- work on the json formatting
- work on the argument parsing for the CLI
- add Cargo.toml file for dependencies (this was initially ignored in the git commit)
